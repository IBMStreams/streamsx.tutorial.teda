The streamsx.tutorial.teda is a documentation project for IBM Streams [com.ibm.streams.teda](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCRJU_4.1.1/com.ibm.streams.toolkits.doc/spldoc/dita/tk$com.ibm.streams.teda/tk$com.ibm.streams.teda.html) toolkit.

# Overview

The Telecommunications Event Data Analytics toolkit provides a set of generic operators that are used in telecommunications applications, and it also provides an application framework that enables you to set up mediation applications. These applications that are capable to process mass data and run near real-time analytics, are based on code templates and support customization, configurable parallel processing, graceful application shutdown, and reliable file processing.
